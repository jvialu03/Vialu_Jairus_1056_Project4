# Project 4: Responsive Web Design

## Media Query
This project is a basic example of using CSS media query to create a responsive web design. This is a single webpage build with 4 columns displayed side by side on a desktop layout. The first and second column will be stacked once the page is shrunk down to mobile layout(641px wide) and column 3 and 4 will not be displayed.
